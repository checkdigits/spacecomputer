Project originally written with [Delphi 11.](https://www.embarcadero.com/products/delphi)

To accompany Ian's session at DelphiCon 2021 - [https://delphicon.embarcadero.com](https://delphicon.embarcadero.com)

Updated to work with version 3.0 and above.
Note that this is a VCL project and therefore the animations can't be transparent which was a change in v3 of Skia4Delphi.
